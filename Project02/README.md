This simple web app was creating using Elm 0.19
The app came from my idea of creating a memory 
game but instead of a grid I used user text input. 
Instructions are listed on the main page: "Click 
'New Value'. Next Choose a diffculty based on time. 
Remember the number and type the number in."
Very simple but is actually kind of fun once you've 
gone though a few levels. There is a randomly 
generated number that appears and the user has to 
remeber that value within the time given and input 
it. If correct it will tell the user to generate a 
new value and try the next level.
